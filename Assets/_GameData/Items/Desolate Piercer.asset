  description: 'An item that increases the wearer''s DMG.


    Long ago, a group
    of scientists discovered a material that returned any object that was infused
    with it to its original state when struck with a destructive blow. It didn''t
    take long for armies to realize it''s potential in wars.


    "What happened
    to the tank sir? I-It''s like nothing happened!"


    "I infused it with Desolite.
    It''s now, immortal."


    "Think of it as... a memory foam property inducer.
    The possibilities are endless."'
